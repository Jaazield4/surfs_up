## Overview of The Analysis
The purpose of the surfs_up analysis is to determine if the weather conditions for Oahu allow for a surf and ice cream shop to be successful in the area. 
In order to prove to investors that Oahu is a great place to set up shop we needed to create an analysis on the weather and more specifically the temperatures for 
June and December. We got both months temperatures to see if Oahu is a good seasonal shop set up or if it will be able to thrive year round!

- During June the temperature is at an average of about 75 degrees with a maximum temperature of 85 which makes surfing and ice cream seem very attractive
- Once winter arrives the average temperature only drops 4 degrees to about 71. The small change in temperature keeps surfing and ice cream popular.
- Even thought there isn't a big change in average temperatures between June and December the low in December drops to 56 degrees. This means that while on average most days are nice to surf and eat ice cream, there will be certain days in December that won't be ideal for the surf shop.
