# surfs_up

## Overview of The Analysis
The purpose of the surfs_up analysis is to determine if the weather conditions for Oahu allow for a surf and ice cream shop to be successful in the area. 
In order to prove to investors that Oahu is a great place to set up shop we needed to create an analysis on the weather and more specifically the temperatures for 
June and December. We got both months temperatures to see if Oahu is a good seasonal shop set up or if it will be able to thrive year round!
